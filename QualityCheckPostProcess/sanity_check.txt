*  These two had marosijo_score 0.30000000000000004 so they belong to this score group and we don't really care about if they are unalignable
   if they are not in the low score group. So this can be ignored.

** Should all be without scores because, preferably, Marosijo is only fed clips that are not marked empty. There were some however.
   Out of all recordings, 64 were both empty but still somehow got Marosijo verified. Out of those 64, 41 clip was found to be be
   still nonverified and requires vote by Marosijo, the other 23 have been manually verified. That is, the 41 clips are a part of the
   46109 clips that require votes by Marosijo, the other 23 are a part of the 1386 which have been manually verified (see numbers in
   stats_report.tsv). 
   So, out of the 64 clips which are marked empty but have still been Marosijo verified, 23 have been manually verified and 41 still require
   votes. They will, of course, be given negative super votes as they are marked as empty. Regardless of their Marosijo scores.

   See: cut -f1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 output_votes.tsv | awk -F" " '$5=="empty"' | cut -f8 | grep -v NAN | wc -l

***They are all on the right range (0.01 - 0.3). They just happen to be marked as empty and empty clips are detected before unalignable clips
   in the script. This does not matter as both get negative super votes. This does not neccessarily have to be fixed because an empty tag has 
   a higher precedence than unalignable tags. An empty clip is definitely bad, so we don't really care if they are alignable or not.
